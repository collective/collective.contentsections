collective.contentsections
==========================

This product offers a block approach for Plone 6 Classic based entirely on Dexterity content types.
It is largely based on the code that was developed in the *imio.smartweb.core* product for the Walloon municipalities.

The approach in this product can be seen as a generalisation of the *Full content* view available in Plone on *Folder* content type.

The plone site is seen as a folder hierarchy that contains pages.
A page is a folderish content type composed of sections.
A section can contain elements of the same type (File, Image, Link). Folders, pages, sections and elements are all Dexterity content types.

The section view view redirects to its position in its parent page view view.
Section content types are hidden from research but their contents are indexed in the *SearchableText* index of their parent page.

Images and files are seen as elements.
Images are only available in images sections and as lead image in all content types.
Files are only available in files sections.
Links are sometimes seen as elements of the links section and sometimes as redirect pages.

Here is a picture of the model.

Demo content
------------

The file https://github.com/sverbois/collective.contentsections/blob/main/demo.json
contains some demo pages that can be loaded into the site using the *@@import_content* view of the *collective.exportimport* product. *collective.exportimport* is installed on the developement environment. You have to hide *Plone Leftcolumn* and *Plone Rightcolumn* portlets on your site to display the pages correctly.

Choices/Beliefs
---------------

- We want a KISS solution. 
- We believe we can create the majority of websites with only one section per row.
- We want a solution for junior integrators.
- We believe that Plone Classic can be used to create beautiful sites in less than a day.
- We don't have any NewsPage content type. We believe it can be replaced by a collection of BasicPAge.

Possibilities
-------------

- If you activate workflow on sections, you can restrict access to certain sections of a page.
- As section are Dexterity content types, you can create a collection/faceted navigation of sections.
